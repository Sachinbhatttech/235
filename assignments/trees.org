* Project 6 Trees

* Final Due Date: TBD


* Folder and files

- Create a folder under assignments named *trees* 
  and place all files there.

- This project requires:
  - A Makefile
  - Doctest based tests
  - At least three targets in the Makefile
    1. main (program executable)
    2. tests (doctest tests executable)
    3. clean (remove the .o files) 
  - Start by copying over either the reference tree code from
    classcode or start with your own.
    
* Important notes
1. As indiciated above, you should test your project using doctest
2. Make sure to use exceptions as we discussed in class to handle error conditions.


* Part 1 - BST Basics - Due Monday 5/2 before class

- Add the insert routine we wrote in class to your Binary Search Tree.
- Next add the search that we defined in class.
- Next, write a recursive version of the search routine.
- Finally, make sure to run the traversal routine (all three versions)
  to see how they output the tree.
